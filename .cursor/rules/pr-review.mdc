## Pragmatic Pre‑PR Self Review (Author)

Use this checklist before opening a PR to catch issues reviewers will flag. Optimized for our stack: React, TypeScript, Tailwind v4, Radix UI, Vite, React Router.

### How to self‑review before opening a PR
- Confirm scope is focused; if large, split by feature/layer.
- Sync with the base branch and ensure a clean local build.
- Run type‑checks, lints, unit tests, relevant integration tests, and the Vite build.
- Run the app, verify affected flows, and capture before/after screenshots if UI changes.
- Write a clear PR description (see template below).
- Self‑review your diff top‑down and add clarifying comments where intent may be unclear.
- Ensure commits are logical and messages are descriptive.

### Core checklist

1) Readability & Naming
- Prefer clear, descriptive names over abbreviations; make long expressions readable with well‑named variables.
- Remove dead code, commented blocks, stray logs, and TODOs. Explain "why" with brief comments when intent is non‑obvious.
- Keep nesting shallow (max ~2–3 levels); use guard clauses and early returns.

2) Modularity & Architecture
- Single responsibility per file/module; extract helpers to `src/utils/` and shared UI to `src/components/shared/ui/`.
- Reuse existing hooks/components before adding new ones; avoid duplication.
- Place files according to project structure; new UI in kebab‑case directories. Do not introduce Material UI/styled‑components in the new product.

3) React + TypeScript correctness
- Functional components with `const` arrow fns; event handlers use `handle*` prefix.
- Strongly type public APIs and component props; avoid `any`. Prefer `type` aliases; avoid enums (use maps).
- Validate hook correctness: dependency arrays complete, no stale closures, minimal memoization used only for actual render hotspots.
- State and effects: prefer derived values over redundant state; keep side‑effects isolated.

4) UI/UX & Accessibility
- Use Tailwind v4 utilities and our tokens: e.g., `rounded-circle`, `text-gray`, `bg-base-*-soft`/`-solid`/`-skeleton`.
- Use Radix UI primitives/components; use `cn()` for conditional classes. Avoid inline styles.
- Ensure semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, focus management, ARIA where needed, and alt text for images.
- Mobile‑first responsive layout; verify small screens.

5) Error handling & Security
- Validate and sanitize inputs; display user‑friendly errors and empty states. Do not swallow errors.
- Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`; if unavoidable, sanitize and document why.
- Respect authentication/authorization boundaries; avoid leaking PII in logs or analytics.

6) Tests & Performance (right‑sized)
- Add/adjust unit tests near the changed files; integration tests in `integration-tests/` for flows. Cover critical paths and edge cases.
- Ensure type‑check, lint, and Vite build succeed; no dev‑only imports in production code.
- Performance: avoid unnecessary re‑renders; keep heavy work out of render paths; deduplicate network calls; consider virtualization for large lists.

### PR preparation (author)
- PR description includes context, motivation, screenshots (before/after), rollout plan, and potential risks.
- Small, focused commits with descriptive messages. Call out breaking changes and migration steps.

### Quick reminders (for this repo)
- Follow folder conventions (`src/components/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/utils/`, `src/routes/`, `src/i18n/`). New code uses kebab‑case.
- Prefer extracting reusable bits into shared UI (`src/components/shared/ui`) and helpers into `src/utils`.
- Match our code style: descriptive names, early returns, minimal nesting, no enums, no inline styles.
