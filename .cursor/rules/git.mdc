# Git Commit Rules

## Commit Message Format
All commit messages MUST follow this format:
```
<type>: <description>
```

## Types
- `feat`: A new feature implementation
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `add`: Adding new functionality that doesn't qualify as a feature
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `chore`: Changes to build process, auxiliary tools, libraries, etc.

## Rules
1. Use the imperative mood in the description ("add" not "added" or "adds")
2. Don't capitalize the first letter of the description
3. No period (.) at the end of the description
4. Keep the description concise and clear
5. Use lowercase for the type
6. Always include a space after the colon
7. If addressing a specific component/area, mention it in the description (e.g., "fix: handle status filtering for opps")

## Examples
```
feat: add user authentication system
fix: resolve data loading issue in dashboard
test: add unit tests for price-utils functions
add: implement tiered pricing logic
refactor: optimize database queries
docs: update API documentation
style: format according to style guide
chore: update dependencies
```
